Project Name- Al-momentous  - An alzheimer's heler App'


Project Summary 

The project is aimed to build simple and easy to use app that helps alzheimer's patients remember events,
help patients stay connected and engaged with friends and family, and recognize faces of friends.
This app aims to help users solve simple issues of their lives. As there is no cure for alzheimer's
disease, we hope to still improve their quality of life for as long as we can.
This paper outlines the results of our initial study and the evaluation of our prototype. Our initial study
was to evaluate a paper prototype of our creation, resulting in very similar studies, however, we
aimed to improve our prototype for the second evaluation based off of the feedback from the initial
study.


Analysis:
A couple notable trends that can be observed right away from, thereâ€™s a lot of mental model overlap
in our app, notably events and reminders, people and contacts and emergency and contact.
However, feedback on the usefulness of the app for those with alzheimer's was fairly high. Though
due to concerns of ecological validity, this should be taken with a grain of salt.
Looking at the flagged difficult tasks, both finding out who uncle ben is and creating a reminder
could both be due to overlap mentioned earlier, though having trouble with notifications different
from them. Though the reasons for this is unknown, it could be that the notifications do not contain
enough info in them, but it could also be an artifact of the study medium, perhaps on an actual
smartphone people would have more context knowledge of how to interact with the notification.
Identify was noted as not being clear what it was for from the home screen, this is a problem
shared with both people and contacts as since they overlap in participants mental models, the
distinction between them is not clear right away. Unfortunately we do not feel there is much more 

we can do to separate these from the home screen. However, we feel that it will be obvious what
identify is for (or not for) when users load up that feature and their camera turns on.
