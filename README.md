Project Name- Al-momentous  - An Alzheimer's helper App


Place  - Dalhousie University


**Project Summary**

The project is aimed to build simple and easy to use app that helps alzheimer's patients remember events,
help patients stay connected and engaged with friends and family, and recognize faces of friends.
This app aims to help users solve simple issues of their lives. As there is no cure for alzheimer's
disease, we hope to still improve their quality of life for as long as we can.
This paper outlines the results of our initial study and the evaluation of our prototype. Our initial study
was to evaluate a paper prototype of our creation, resulting in very similar studies, however, we
aimed to improve our prototype for the second evaluation based off of the feedback from the initial
study.


**Prototype**

L0w fidelity Prototype- Paper prototype - Paper and pen
Medium Fidelity Prototypes - Microsoft Word
High fidelity Prototype - Smart Draw  andf Figma

The home screen has the following features:

Photos: Have all the photos of their loved ones and friends. The photos will be tagged with the
names of friends. The pictures are grouped by a person by using facial recognition. These
photos could also be shared by friends and family with one tap as they join the app’s circle

Events: This consists of the date, time and the upcoming events of the day. This helps the user
remember various activities and appointments. The feature will be managed by the caregiver
or the loved ones who could add events to the calendar.

Contacts: Helps patients who have difficulty remembering phone numbers. It would have a
picture of the person and the relation to the patient beneath it.

Identify: Patients are often faced with the difficulty of recognizing people around them. This
feature helps in taking pictures which in turn would recognize the person with the help of facial
recognition technology.

Help Line: Help feature has a list of emergency contact lists like 911, counselling services,
doctor’s number etc.


**Evaluation Of Prototype**

Users found a few issues with our first prototype. However,
none of them were truly app-breaking, based off of feedback
on how difficult the requested tasks were easy to complete.
Notable issues highlighted were overlap between creating an
event and a reminder, potential confusion when accessing
emergency but being taken to the contacts page (especially
in a high stress emergency situation). Despite these issues,
users rated the potential usefulness of our app fairly well
(average of 3.7 out of 5).

**Prototype Improvements**

Based on the evaluation of our initial prototype we decided
to  combine events and reminders, make the emergency button on the home page
link to a separate page with emergency numbers, and add
links between a Person’s page and their corresponding
Contacts page (and vice versa).



**Future Work**

Moving forward we will have to consider how to handle
notifications with our app, trying to strike a balance
between allowing those who know/remember
notifications to have easier simpler actions and those don’t
be able to figure out what to do with them. Currently, the
mobile app is designed to cater to the Alzheimer patients
indirectly, such that caretakers are operating the mobile
app for setting up the upcoming events and other
reminders to assist the patients. As future work, we plan
to create a sister app that caretakers could link to create
these reminders, contacts and info on loved ones.
